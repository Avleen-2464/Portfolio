                    <p>We started our project by deciding which tech stack to use. After a lot of discussion and research, we chose the MERN stack – MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js – because it's flexible and works well for full-stack development. I began by designing a rough wireframe of how the app should look and what features it would include. We wanted it to feel like a personal mental health assistant, so the wireframe included a landing page, login/register, dashboard, chat section, journal, and goals section.</p>
                    <p>Once we finalized the layout, I set up the basic React app using Vite for fast development. I organized the folder structure neatly, so it's easy to scale. We also installed basic dependencies like React Router for page navigation and Axios for sending API requests later.</p>
                    <p>We kept the design clean and minimal so users can focus on chatting and journaling without distractions. Setting up the base in the beginning really helped us stay organized throughout the project. This step gave us a clear vision of how our final product would look and work.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-2" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>In this phase, I started working on the backend of our project. I used Node.js and Express.js to build the server. First, I created a simple Express app and set up the required routes like /register, /login, and /dashboard. I added basic middleware like express.json() and enabled CORS so the frontend and backend could communicate without issues.</p>
                    <p>We also connected the backend to MongoDB using Mongoose. I created schemas for the User model, which includes fields like name, email, password, and journal entries. It was a bit tricky to connect with MongoDB Atlas at first due to network access errors, but after whitelisting IP addresses and updating the connection string, it worked smoothly.</p>
                    <p>For authentication, I implemented JWT tokens. This helps keep users logged in and ensures that only logged-in users can access certain parts of the app. I tested the routes using Postman to make sure everything was working correctly.</p>
                    <p>By the end of this week, we had a solid backend foundation ready. This allowed us to start building real features like saving user data, creating journals, and more. Setting up a clean backend early saved us a lot of time during later stages.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-3" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>A big part of our project is the chatbot that interacts with users like a friend. So this week, we focused on exploring different chatbot APIs. We first looked at OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The responses were accurate and smooth, but there were a few problems. The biggest issue was that OpenAI is a paid service and has usage limits. This would make it harder for us to integrate freely and test without worrying about cost.</p>
                    <p>Then we discovered Ollama, an open-source tool that allows us to run language models locally. Ollama seemed like a great fit because we could avoid API limits and customize the responses more. However, we also realized it required a good system with strong GPU/CPU specs to run heavy models smoothly.</p>
                    <p>We tested both by sending sample prompts and checked the style of replies. OpenAI was better in accuracy and fluency, but Ollama gave us the freedom to modify how the bot behaves, which is exactly what we needed for a friendly mental health chatbot. This comparison helped us decide which model would serve our purpose better while giving us flexibility in future development.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-4" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>After trying different APIs, we decided to go ahead with Ollama and selected the Ollama 3 model for our chatbot. The main reason was that we wanted to keep everything customizable and free of API limits, and Ollama allowed us to run models locally on our system without any external dependencies.</p>
                    <p>We downloaded and integrated Ollama 3, which is a large language model capable of generating human-like responses. Initially, everything looked good — the responses were detailed and the personality of the bot felt friendly. But very quickly, we noticed a major drawback: slow response times. Since the model is very heavy, it used a lot of system resources and made the server lag.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, the response took so long that it gave timeout errors, especially when multiple messages were sent in a short time. This made the user experience frustrating. We tried optimizing by tweaking settings, but it still wasn't smooth enough for a real-time chatbot.</p>
                    <p>Although we were happy with the quality of the replies, the performance wasn't suitable for fast, fluid conversations. This week taught us a lot about the trade-off between quality and speed when it comes to running large models locally.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-5" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>After facing issues with Ollama 3 being too slow and resource-heavy, we started exploring other lighter versions of models that could still give decent replies. We found Ollama3.2:3B, a smaller version of the model, which claimed to offer good speed while still understanding user prompts well.</p>
                    <p>We installed it and tested it with our existing chatbot setup. Right away, we noticed a big improvement in speed and responsiveness. The replies were generated much faster, and there were no lag issues like we had with the heavier model. Although the replies were slightly shorter and a bit less "intelligent" than the full model, it was a worthwhile trade-off for the smooth performance.</p>
                    <p>This version made the chatbot more usable in real-time. We could now send multiple messages and get replies instantly, which made the overall experience more natural and user-friendly. It also reduced the chance of the app crashing due to memory overload.</p>
                    <p>So, we officially replaced the heavy model with this lighter one and continued building our app around it. Finding the right balance between performance and quality was a big step forward in our project.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-6" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>Now that we had a fast and stable version of the model (Ollama3.2:3B), we moved on to fine-tuning its behavior. Our goal was to make the chatbot feel like a friendly companion, not a generic robot. We adjusted different parameters like temperature, top_p, and max_tokens to make replies more natural and emotionally engaging.</p>
                    <p>We also wrote custom system prompts to guide the model's tone. For example, we told the model to be empathetic, avoid giving harsh advice, and encourage users to open up. This made the replies softer, friendlier, and more human. It actually started responding like a casual friend checking in.</p>
                    <p>We tested it with real conversation samples to see how it responded to emotional or sensitive topics. Some replies were still a bit robotic, but overall, it was a big improvement from the default setting.</p>
                    <p>Tuning the model was not easy — small changes in parameters sometimes made big differences in behavior. But after many tests, we found a sweet spot where the model sounded friendly, stayed on topic, and gave short, helpful replies. This made the chatbot experience much better and more engaging.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-7" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>This week, I focused on building the full frontend flow for users. I started with the landing page, which gives users an overview of the app and its purpose — helping them interact and reflect on their mental health through conversation.</p>
                    <p>After that, I set up the authentication system. I created clean and simple register and login forms using React and Bootstrap. The data from these forms is sent to the backend using Axios. I implemented form validation to ensure users enter proper information.</p>
                    <p>Once registered or logged in, users are redirected to the dashboard. I used React Router for navigating between pages and added protected routes so that users who are not logged in can't access restricted areas. JWT tokens are stored in localStorage and sent in the header with each request.</p>
                    <p>Making the authentication system work smoothly was really satisfying. It gave the app a proper flow and allowed us to move ahead with more user-based features like journals and goals.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-8" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>After completing the login system, I worked on the dashboard, which is the main area users interact with. I divided it into multiple sections: Chatbot, Calendar, and Goals. The layout was built using Bootstrap cards and grids to keep things clean and mobile-responsive.</p>
                    <p>The chatbot section is where users talk with the AI. It was connected to the backend API that talks to the Ollama model. I added loading indicators, scroll behavior, and proper styling for messages.</p>
                    <p>Then I added a calendar component using react-calendar. This shows which days the user has written a journal or interacted deeply. It helps users track their emotional activity over time.</p>
                    <p>The goals section lets users set personal goals, like "meditate daily" or "sleep on time." These are stored in MongoDB and retrieved each time the user logs in. We kept the design minimal but functional.</p>
                    <p>This week brought the whole user experience together. All the major features started working in one place, giving us a solid app feel. Seeing the dashboard come to life was a huge milestone for us.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="blog-post-9" class="blog-post-full" style="display: none;">
                    <p>This week I worked on the journal section, which is a key part of our app. The idea was that, based on the chat with the AI, a summary journal entry would be generated automatically and saved for the user. I created a separate journal page on the dashboard where users can view all their past journals.</p>
                    <p>I built the backend route /generate-journal that receives chat history, sends it to the model, and stores the summary. However, this part is still facing some issues. Sometimes the model gives strange or empty responses, and sometimes the journal fails to save due to backend errors.</p>
                    <p>Despite the issue, I managed to connect the journal entries with the calendar so that it marks the days with successful journal generation. The UI part is done — users can view entries and navigate by date.</p>
                    <p>We've added error handling for failed journal generation and logs to trace what's going wrong. Fixing this is our top priority now. Even though it's not working 100% yet, the structure is ready, and we're almost there!</p>
